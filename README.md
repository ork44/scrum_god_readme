### Marian is the Product Owner envisioning a project for a new release of her product. She made a projection of a release date based upon a sustained velocity of 17 completed units of work per Sprint. Over the first 3 Sprints, the average velocity was 13 for work that the Development Team estimated as 90% done. The Development Teams, feeling the need to meet the plan, figured that a velocity of 17 was within their reach. A good way to continue is:

- [x] The Development Team makes sure that all of the selected scope per Sprint is as "Done" as possible. The undone work is estimated and added to the Sprint Backlog of the next Sprint, so it doesn't mess up the Product Backlog.
- [ ] Add enough people to the Development Team for the deadline to be made.
- [ ] The opportunity to inspect and adapt is lost. Opaqueness has replaced transparency. Predictability has dropped below zero. The produced software is not usable.

### You have six teams using a traditional method to deliver a product. Your management has asked you to start using Scrum. In the initial project there were separate plans and teams for the layers of a software system, i.e. one for the frontend, one for the middle tier, one for the back-end, and one for the interfaces and services. This resembles what is known as component teams. But you have read that it's a good idea to have teams organized by feature. What are the advantages of keeping component teams while starting Scrum?

- [x] There's less initial disruption than organizing into new teams. As they start, they will discover what works best, and how to potentially re-organize towards this.
- [ ] Component teams generally have the skills needed to create a working Increment of software that provides business value.
- [ ] Because they have worked together for some time, they are likely able to start producing shippable Increments faster that new feature teams would.
- [ ] There are fewer cross-team dependencies than working in feature teams.

### A Development Team asks their Product Owner to re-order the Product Backlog. The team is waiting for an external supplier to deliver a specific software component. Without that component there won't be enough work in the next Sprint to occupy the full team. The Product Owner asks the Scrum Master for help. What would be good advice to give the Product Owner?

- [x] Remind the Product Owner that his primary concern is the flow of value reflected in the ordering of the Product Backlog.
- [ ] Tell the Product Owner to re-order the Product Backlog so the work involving the external component can be planned in a separate sprint.
